# Amicable-Numbers-Program
This program generates all pairs of amicable numbers from 0 to a user defined limit.
Includes command line argument checking, and parallel computing to have the program run faster.
Users get to choose what number they want to see all of the pairs up to, and how many threads the program uses.
